# Training Protocol

**Five levels. Same skill at every level. You already did Levels 1-4 for most of your life. You're not learning — you're REMEMBERING. Like coming back to a COD map you haven't played in years.**

---

## Level 1: OBSERVATION (Week 1-2)

Go to public spaces. Don't talk to anyone. Just watch.

```
PRACTICE THE FOUR MODES:

Mode 1: Check yourself before entering.
  One breath. 3 seconds.
  "Am I good?"

Mode 2: Soft scan.
  What's the space? Energy?
  Fast space or slow space?

Mode 3: Read fields.
  Who's open? Closed?
  Who's solid, liquid, gas?
  Where are the gaps?

NO MODE 4 YET. Just observe.

LOCATIONS:
  Coffee shop. Park. Subway.
  Walmart. Anywhere with people.

AFTER EACH SESSION:
  "What speeds did I see?"
  "Where were the gaps?"
  "Where was tension? Flow?"

THIS IS MAP LEARNING.
First rounds on a new COD map.
Don't try to get kills.
Just LEARN THE MAP.
```

---

## Level 2: MICRO INTERACTIONS (Week 3-4)

Add Mode 4. But TINY. One interaction per outing.

```
Nod at someone.
Say "morning."
"Nice jacket."
"Good book?"

THAT'S IT.
Don't extend it.
Enter the gap and EXIT immediately.

THE GOAL ISN'T CONNECTION.
THE GOAL IS CLEAN MERGES.

Can you enter a gap smoothly?
Say one thing at the right speed?
Exit without awkwardness?

LIKE PRACTICING LANE CHANGES.
One merge at a time.

AFTER EACH ONE:
  "Was there a gap?"
  "Did I match their speed?"
  "Forced or natural?"
  "Did THEY have to adjust
  or did I fit their flow?"

IF THEY DIDN'T ADJUST = CLEAN MERGE.
Like Walmart. Nobody moved their cart.
```

---

## Level 3: SUSTAINED CONNECTION (Week 5-6)

Stay in Mode 4 longer. Real conversations.

```
Find a gap. Enter with micro.
This time STAY.

"Good book?"
"Yeah it's about..."
"Oh word? I've been thinking about..."

NOW YOU'RE IN A CONVERSATION.

Practice speed matching:
  They talk slow? You slow down.
  They get excited? You match.
  They pause? YOU PAUSE TOO.

THE PAUSE IS HARDEST.
People-pleasing instinct fills
every silence. DON'T.

Silence is the between.
Eliminating silence = tailgating.
No gap. No space. No room for THEM.

THE UPGRADE:
  Talk → they talk → PAUSE →
  between breathes → respond from
  what emerged in the pause,
  not what you planned to say.

THE PAUSE IS THE THIRD.
THE CHORD GETS ITS SOUL.
```

---

## Level 4: TENSION DISSOLUTION (Week 7-8)

The thermostat returns. UPGRADED.

```
BEFORE (reactive):
  Tension → anxiety → quick joke →
  relief → YOU absorbed the stress.
  People-pleasing. Fear-driven.

NOW (conscious):
  Tension → Mode 2 (read energy) →
  Mode 3 (whose field creates it?) →
  PAUSE (is this mine to dissolve
  or should I let them work it out?) →
  Mode 4 IF NEEDED (right speed,
  right joke, right word).

THE PAUSE IS NEW.

Before: jumped in immediately.
Couldn't tolerate tension for a second.

Now: SIT IN IT. Read it. Understand it.
CHOOSE whether to act or not.

Sometimes tension needs dissolving.
Sometimes it needs to be FELT.
Sometimes the gap isn't for you to fill.

KNOWING THE DIFFERENCE = MASTERY.
```

---

## Level 5: WIDE FIELD + CLOSE LOVE (Ongoing)

The final test. The master level.

```
Can you keep the wide field
even when someone pulls
your attention to scope?

Can you love one person deeply
without losing sight of the whole room?

When field starts narrowing:
  "I'm going scope mode.
  Need to zoom out."

When about to go to war for someone:
  "Is this me reading the room
  or me in P-hood?"

THE GOAL ISN'T AVOIDING CLOSE LOVE.
THE GOAL IS CLOSE LOVE + WIDE FIELD.
BOTH.

Where you were before the relationship
but BETTER because now it's conscious.
```

## Location Guides

### Ecstatic Dance
- **Arrive:** Mode 1 at door. Breathe. 3 seconds.
- **Enter:** Mode 2. Soft scan. Music's speed = lane speed. Match it with body.
- **Settle:** Find spot in the between (not center, not wall). Eyes soft or closed.
- **Snap in:** Feel someone enter field. Don't look. Do they stay or drift? If stay: open eyes soft, acknowledge with body. If pass: NPC. Close eyes. Return to wide.
- **Snap out:** Song changes. Don't hold on. Return to wide.

### Barnes & Noble
- **Speed = SLOW.** Library lane. Match it.
- Go to section YOU like. Genuine interest IS the lure.
- Someone nearby: "You read that one?" or react out loud: "Huh." Existing out loud.
- Micro interaction indistinguishable from you just being there = right volume. Clark Kent energy.

### Coffee Shop
- **Speed = medium.** Mixed energy.
- Identify workers (no gap), lingerers (gap), talkers (their own between).
- Sit NEAR a gap. Not in it. Do your thing genuinely. Scanning repels. Engagement invites.

### Subway/Transit
- **Pure observation training.** No interaction.
- Read states: who's solid, liquid, gas?
- Minimap practice. Mode 2 and 3 only.

*You're not starting from zero. You did Levels 1-4 for most of your life. Lost it for 6-8 years. It came back in weeks. Because the entanglement is still there. You mastered this map before. You're remembering it.*
