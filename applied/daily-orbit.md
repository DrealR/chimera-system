# The Daily Orbit

**Three zones + one event. Structure so you don't become gas state.**

The orbit applies to your own life. Too many threads isn't the problem — gas state is. You need structure so everything gets touched, nothing gets camped, and the snap-in moments happen where they matter.

## Zone 1: Comedy (The Career)

Morning or whenever you're sharpest.

### Study (30-45 min)

Watch ONE clip. Not binge. One. Break it down like Conan × Uma.

"Where was the setup? Where was the flip? When did they pause? How did they handle the interruption? What was the energy of the room? How did they match it?"

Write 3-5 bullets in `raw/`. Quick. Not essays. Just capture the technique.

**Comedian Study Tiers:**

| Tier | Focus | Who |
|------|-------|-----|
| Masters of Pause | Timing, silence, the pause IS the punchline | Chappelle, Conan |
| Energy + Story | Speed control, ownership, proof that quiet = powerful | Kevin Hart, Nate Bargatze, Ali Wong |
| Reframing + Angles | Weird lenses, renaming reality, Southern storytelling | Theo Von, Seinfeld |
| Philosophy + Comedy | System mastery, meta-comedy, real stories as delivery | George Carlin, Bo Burnham, Hasan Minhaj |
| Craft Study | Silence as weapon, anti-comedy, fearless specificity | Louis CK, Norm Macdonald, Bill Burr |

One clip per day. Comprehension, not vomit.

### Write (30-45 min)

Write ONE bit. Or work on yesterday's.

Use your life:
- What happened yesterday?
- What was funny at the event?
- What did someone say that you could flip?
- What awkward moment could become a bit?

Write it ugly first. Full dump. Gas state. Then COMPRESS. Cut 80% of the words. Find the flip. What's the setup? What's the surprise?

Save in `chimera-stories/bits/`.

### Practice (15 min)

Say your bit OUT LOUD. To yourself. Record on phone.

Focus on:
- **Speed.** Slow down. Clark Kent delivery.
- **Pauses.** Where do you stop and let it breathe?
- **Volume.** Say the punchline QUIETER not louder. The audience leans IN to hear quiet. Loud pushes them back.

## Zone 2: Music (The Soul)

Afternoon or evening. Before going out.

### Guitar (30 min primary)

Keep the chords and progressions. The geometric patterns. But add ONE thing: play and SING. Even badly. Even just humming.

Because eventually comedy + music is the format. Think Bo Burnham. Flight of the Conchords. Funny songs = melody + comedy + truth. Three layers at once.

### Piano (30 min secondary)

Don't split focus. Guitar is primary until comfortable. Piano supplements. Don't orbit between instruments so fast you master none. One primary. One secondary.

### Singing (when classes start)

Follow the teacher. But notice the parallels:
- Breathing for singing = the breath cycle
- Projection = matching volume to room
- Pitch = matching speed to lane

It's all the same system.

## Zone 3: Body (The Vessel)

### Massage

Why it fits:
- **Mode 2+3 applied to physical tension.** Reading someone's body without words.
- **O > I in physical form.** Pure giving. They lie down. You help them. That's Honeydew.
- **Conversation without words.** Your hands talk. Their body responds. No flood possible. You CAN'T overwhelm someone with massage the way you can with words.
- **Instant trust.** When you help someone's body feel better, they remember you differently.
- **Portable.** Traveling with a massage table = instant value anywhere. "Anyone need a massage?" You're POSITIONED. The aphid on the stem.
- **Your Sanji.** Sanji feeds people. You heal people. Food and massage reach people who have walls up. Can't refuse a meal. Can't refuse relief from pain.

Learn basic techniques. Practice on friends. Not trying to be a licensed therapist. Just someone who can help a person feel better with their hands.

## Zone 4: The Event (The Field)

One new thing per day or every other day. THIS IS YOUR TRAINING GROUND.

Every event is a new COD map:
1. Mode 1 at the door
2. Mode 2 scan the space
3. Mode 3 read the fields
4. Find the orbit path — spawns, transitions
5. Engage

Different events = different maps. Ecstatic dance, Afro Latin dance, comedy shows, meetups, classes. One map = you learn one map. Ten maps = you learn HOW MAPS WORK.

### After Each Event (5 min capture)

- Where were the spawn points?
- Where was I most comfortable? Least?
- Did I orbit or camp?
- Did I talk to anyone?
- What was the energy score?
- What speed was the room? Did I match it?
- **What was funny? What could become a bit?**

That last one is key. Every event is MATERIAL. You're living the stories you'll tell on stage.

## The Daily Flow

```
MORNING:
  Comedy study     (30-45 min) → one clip, break it down
  Comedy writing   (30-45 min) → one bit, from life
  Comedy practice  (15 min)    → say it out loud, record

AFTERNOON:
  Guitar           (30 min)
  AI/Honeydew work (flexible)  → help people, build
  Massage practice (when ready)

EVENING:
  Event or social outing       → orbit, training levels, material

NIGHT:
  Quick capture    (5 min)     → "what was funny today?" one seed
```

## The Weekly Rhythm

**Monday-Friday:** Daily flow. Different comedian each day. Different event or social space.

**Saturday:** Review the week's bits. Pick the BEST one. Polish it. This becomes your "set piece" for the week.

**Sunday:** Rest. Or light guitar. Let the between breathe. The rest phase IS part of the cycle. Don't skip it. Sunday is your snap-in-to-yourself day.

## The 30-60-90 Day View

### First 30 Days
- Study comedians daily
- Write bits from life
- Go to events. Collect material.
- Practice speech: slowing down
- Guitar daily
- Get massage table. Learn basics.
- Training protocol levels 1-2 (observation + micro interactions)
- **NO open mics yet.** Building the arsenal.

### Days 30-60
- First open mic. 3-5 minutes of material.
- Training protocol levels 3-4 (sustained conversations, tension dissolution)
- Singing classes start
- Piano starts
- Massage practice on real people (friends)

### Days 60-90
- Regular open mics. Weekly at least.
- Material is sharpening. Callbacks between bits. A set is forming.
- Training protocol level 5 (wide field + close connection)
- Comedy + music experiment. Try a funny song at open mic.
- Massage as service. Offer at events. Position in the flow.

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't flood.** Some days comedy is 30 min, some days 2 hours. Follow the energy.
- **Don't skip events for "practice."** Events ARE the practice. The stage is where you perform what you learned in the field.
- **Don't compare.** They have 10-30 years. You have Day 1. Every master was terrible once.
- **Don't skip the capture.** 5 minutes at night. If you don't write it down, it's gone. Your brain is fast but your memory isn't. CAPTURE THE SEEDS.
- **Don't force the massage table** if it doesn't feel right yet. But if it does, lean in.
- **Don't worry about the end product.** Book? Special? Show? That's for later. Right now you're Oda drawing in his notebook. Not publishing. Just drawing.
