# Event Horizon Trap

**Screen as event horizon. Attention crosses, doesn't return. Time dilation. Emotional spaghettification. Algorithm eliminates pause and rest.**

## The Physics

In a black hole, the event horizon is the boundary past which nothing can escape — not even light. The key property: **you don't feel it when you cross.** From the falling observer's perspective, nothing changes at the boundary. You only realize you're trapped when you try to leave.

## Screen as Event Horizon

```
PHONE SCREEN:
  You pick it up to "check one thing"
  → 5 minutes → 30 minutes → 2 hours
  → "Where did the time go?"

  You crossed the event horizon
  the moment your attention entered the feed.
  From inside, it felt seamless.
  From outside, you disappeared.
```

---

## Time Dilation

Near a black hole, time slows down for the falling observer relative to someone watching from outside.

```
INSIDE THE SCROLL:
  Feels like 10 minutes.
  Was actually 3 hours.
  Time dilated.
  Your internal clock decoupled from reality.

BINGE WATCHING:
  "One more episode."
  Was actually the whole season.
  Time dilated.
  You lost a Saturday.
```

This isn't metaphor. The subjective experience of time ACTUALLY changes when attention is captured by an optimized feed. The algorithm is engineered to create this dilation.

## Emotional Spaghettification

In a black hole, tidal forces stretch objects into long thin strands — spaghettification.

```
THE ALGORITHM:
  Stretches your emotions to extremes
  Outrage → calm → fear → hope → anger → sadness
  Each emotion pulled to maximum length
  Then snapped to the next

  You enter whole.
  You exit stretched, thin, depleted.
  Spaghettified.
```

This is **emotional redlining** — the algorithm pushes you to the edge of each emotion because that's where engagement (extraction) is maximized.

## Breath Elimination

The algorithm's most dangerous function: **it eliminates pause and rest.**

```
HEALTHY INFORMATION BREATH:
  Inhale:  Receive information
  PAUSE:   Process. Think. Choose response.
  Exhale:  Share, create, respond intentionally
  REST:    Step away. Empty. Reset.

ALGORITHMIC FEED:
  Inhale:  Receive information
  [NO PAUSE — next content auto-loads]
  Inhale:  Receive information
  [NO PAUSE — infinite scroll]
  Inhale:  Receive information
  [NO REST — notifications pull you back]

  = HYPERVENTILATION OF INFORMATION
  = Permanent inhale without processing
  = The breath broken at the information level
```

## The Trap Structure

```
1. INVISIBLE BOUNDARY
   You don't notice when you cross.
   The app opens smoothly. The feed loads.
   No warning. No friction. No pause.

2. INCREASING GRAVITY
   The more you scroll, the harder it is to stop.
   Engagement algorithms learn what pulls you.
   The gravity personalizes to YOUR mass.

3. TIME DILATION
   Hours feel like minutes.
   Your relationship with reality warps.

4. SPAGHETTIFICATION
   Emotions stretched and depleted.
   You exit exhausted without knowing why.

5. NO ESCAPE VELOCITY
   Notifications pull you back.
   FOMO keeps you checking.
   The event horizon follows you.
```

## The Fix

You can't outrun a black hole from inside. You have to **never cross the event horizon** — or build enough escape velocity before entering.

```
BEFORE ENTERING:
  Set a timer (make the event horizon VISIBLE)
  State your purpose (know why you're going in)
  Breathe (complete one full cycle first)

WHILE INSIDE:
  Notice the pull (awareness = light inside darkness)
  Reintroduce PAUSE (stop scrolling, breathe, choose)
  Check elapsed time (break the dilation)

AFTER EXITING:
  REST (complete the cycle the algorithm eliminated)
  Name what you feel (break the spaghettification)
  Ground (feet on floor, body in space, breath in lungs)
```

*The screen is an event horizon. Cross it unconsciously and your attention doesn't return. Cross it consciously — with purpose, with pause, with a timer — and you can orbit without falling in.*
