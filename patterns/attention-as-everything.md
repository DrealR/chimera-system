# Attention as Everything

**Every pattern in CHIMERA is an attention pattern. Entanglement = accumulated attention. Gravity = attention from others. Flow = attention in motion. Membrane = attention control. Attention has four functions: Lure, Shield, Engine, Climate Control. One resource. Four powers. CHIMERA is a theory of attention.**

## The Unified Currency

```
WHAT IS ENTANGLEMENT?
  Repeated ATTENTION to a space.
  Play the same map 100 times =
  100 sessions of attention.
  Sit in the same seat for months =
  months of attention.

  ATTENTION IS THE CURRENCY
  OF ENTANGLEMENT.

WHAT IS GRAVITY?
  Accumulated attention
  from others toward you.
  25 kill streak =
  everyone's attention on you.
  Celebrity =
  millions' attention on you.

WHAT IS FLOW?
  Attention moving through
  a system.
  Spawns through a map.
  Money through an economy.
  Blood through a body.

WHAT IS SPAWN PROTECTION?
  The system protecting
  your attention from overwhelm.
  Can't spawn on someone =
  can't FORCE attention
  on someone instantly.
  There's always DISTANCE.
  Distance = time.
  Time = space to CHOOSE
  where to put attention.
```

---

## Every Pattern Is Attention

```
ENTANGLEMENT =
  accumulated attention
  toward a space.

GRAVITY =
  accumulated attention
  from others toward you.

FLOW =
  attention in motion.

EXCLUSION =
  protection of attention
  from being overwhelmed.

MEMBRANE =
  what controls how much
  attention gets in or out.

NP-HOOD =
  choosing where to put
  attention CONSCIOUSLY.

P-HOOD =
  attention HIJACKED
  by emotion/gravity.

COMPREHENSION =
  processing what attention
  has been given to.

THE BREATH =
  attention's natural rhythm.
  Inhale: attention in.
  Pause: attention processes.
  Exhale: attention out.
  Rest: attention recovers.
```

## Every Axiom Is Attention

```
TWO FORCES:
  Star = radiates attention outward.
  Black hole = concentrates
  attention inward.
  Same force. Different direction.

DISTANCE:
  Attention weakens with distance.
  L = B(s₁×s₂)/d².
  Close = intense attention.
  Far = diluted attention.

THE RATIO:
  More attention givers (stars)
  than attention takers (black holes).
  The universe is built
  for giving attention,
  not hoarding it.

TOPOLOGY:
  Love = attention that circulates.
  Flows out and comes back.
  Greed = attention that accumulates.
  Flows in and doesn't return.

THE BREATH:
  Attention has a natural rhythm.
  Forced constant attention =
  hyperventilation.
  No attention = flat line.
  The healthy cycle: in, process,
  out, rest.

SYSTEM ANATOMY:
  Every system has parts that
  attract attention (black holes),
  parts that radiate it (stars),
  boundaries (membranes),
  stable patterns (orbits),
  and danger zones (event horizons).
```

## Every Equation Is Attention

```
LOVE EQUATION:
  L = (O > I) + P + ¬F
  Give more attention than you take.
  Be patient with attention.
  Don't force attention.

FLIGHT EQUATION:
  L = B(s₁×s₂)/d²
  Attention force between two people
  based on belief and distance.

BREATH WAVEFORM:
  B(t) = A*sin(2πft+φ)
  Attention oscillates naturally.
  Amplitude = depth.
  Frequency = speed.

COMPREHENSION COST:
  A(n) = C/K(n)
  Attention cost decreases
  as knowledge grows.
  Mastery = same understanding,
  less attention required.

MEMBRANE FUNCTION:
  P(x) = how much attention
  passes through.
  Too open = overwhelmed.
  Too closed = isolated.

HONEYDEW RATIO:
  Keep 5% of attention for self.
  Flow 95% outward as service.

## Every Game Is Attention

```
COD:
  Control spawns through position.
  Control ATTENTION through
  kills and signature.

CHESS:
  Control squares through pieces.
  Control ATTENTION through
  threats and misdirection.

BASKETBALL:
  Control court through movement.
  Control ATTENTION through
  fakes and screens.

BUSINESS:
  Control market through positioning.
  Control ATTENTION through
  branding and presence.

RELATIONSHIPS:
  Control connection through
  proximity and time.
  Control ATTENTION through
  being genuine and present.

THE GAME IS ALWAYS:
  1. Understand the space
  2. Position in the flow
  3. Direct attention
  4. Let gravity do the rest

  ¬F at every level.
```

## The Attention Economy Is Literal

```
NOT METAPHOR. MECHANISM.

When people say "attention economy"
they think it's a metaphor
for social media.

IT'S NOT.

ATTENTION IS THE ACTUAL
FUNDAMENTAL CURRENCY
OF ALL SYSTEMS.

Money is crystallized attention.
  Someone paid attention to work.
  Got paid money.
  Money = stored attention.

Love is flowing attention.
  Someone pays attention to you.
  Consistently. Deeply.
  Love = sustained attention.

Gravity is accumulated attention.
  An object collected mass.
  Mass = accumulated "attention"
  from the universe (other mass
  pulling toward it).

EVERYTHING IS ATTENTION
AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS
AND DENSITIES.

Frozen attention = matter.
Flowing attention = energy.
Oscillating attention = waves.
Directed attention = force.
Accumulated attention = gravity.
Protected attention = membrane.
Released attention = love.
Hoarded attention = greed.

THE WHOLE FRAMEWORK IS
AN ATTENTION THEORY.

Not metaphorically.
LITERALLY.

## The Four Functions of Attention

```
YOUR ATTENTION IS SIMULTANEOUSLY:

1. A LURE (anglerfish)
   Show yourself → they chase →
   walk into your position.
   Attention as BAIT.
   Show 10%, let them chase 90%.

2. A SHIELD (observer exclusion)
   Where you look =
   where things CAN'T spawn.
   Attention as EXCLUSION FIELD.
   Two fields: proximity + observation.
   Things spawn behind you,
   not in front.

3. AN ENGINE (comprehension)
   Take in the whole situation →
   digest it → output better action.
   Attention as PROCESSING POWER.
   Comprehension > reaction.
   Digestion > vomiting.

4. A CLIMATE CONTROLLER (density)
   Choose what gets your attention →
   choose the density of your map →
   choose your temperature.
   Attention as PEACE SELECTOR.
   Fewer entities = cooler = calmer.

ONE RESOURCE.
FOUR FUNCTIONS.

And most people use
ZERO of them consciously.

They let attention be pulled
by whatever's loudest.
P-hood. Reactive. Controlled
by external gravity.

NP-HOOD = using all four
consciously.

THAT'S THE GAME.
NOT COD.
THE GAME.
THE REAL ONE.

Who controls your attention
controls your reality.
Your spawns. Your flow.
Your density. Your peace.
Your power.

MASTER ATTENTION =
MASTER EVERYTHING.

Because attention is
the ONLY resource.
Everything else is downstream.
```

---

## Two Gravity Fields

```
YOUR ATTENTION CREATES
TWO SIMULTANEOUS FIELDS:

PROXIMITY FIELD (spherical):
  Where your body IS.
  Radiates in all directions.
  Things can't spawn on you.
  Physical exclusion.

OBSERVATION FIELD (directional):
  Where your eyes LOOK.
  Cone extending forward.
  Things are less likely
  to spawn where you're watching.
  Attention exclusion.

BEHIND YOU:
  Only proximity exclusion.
  Smaller zone.
  More spawning possible.

IN FRONT OF YOU:
  Proximity + observation.
  Larger zone.
  Less spawning possible.

WIDE ATTENTION = NP-HOOD.
  See the whole map.
  Few surprises.
  Positioned.
  Soft focus. Minimap view.

NARROW ATTENTION = P-HOOD.
  Tunnel vision on one thing.
  Everything else spawns
  unnoticed around you.
  Surprised constantly.
  "Where did he come from?!"

  He spawned behind you
  because your observation field
  was pointed elsewhere.
  The universe filled in
  the gaps you weren't watching.
```

*Every CHIMERA pattern is an attention pattern. Attention has four functions: Lure (bait), Shield (exclusion), Engine (comprehension), Climate Control (density). Two gravity fields: proximity (where you are) and observation (where you look). Wide attention = NP-hood. Narrow attention = P-hood. Attention isn't a metaphor for value — it IS value. Master attention, master everything.*
