# Attention as Everything

**Every pattern in CHIMERA is an attention pattern. Entanglement = accumulated attention. Gravity = attention from others. Flow = attention in motion. Membrane = attention control. CHIMERA is a theory of attention.**

## The Unified Currency

```
WHAT IS ENTANGLEMENT?
  Repeated ATTENTION to a space.
  Play the same map 100 times =
  100 sessions of attention.
  Sit in the same seat for months =
  months of attention.

  ATTENTION IS THE CURRENCY
  OF ENTANGLEMENT.

WHAT IS GRAVITY?
  Accumulated attention
  from others toward you.
  25 kill streak =
  everyone's attention on you.
  Celebrity =
  millions' attention on you.

WHAT IS FLOW?
  Attention moving through
  a system.
  Spawns through a map.
  Money through an economy.
  Blood through a body.

WHAT IS SPAWN PROTECTION?
  The system protecting
  your attention from overwhelm.
  Can't spawn on someone =
  can't FORCE attention
  on someone instantly.
  There's always DISTANCE.
  Distance = time.
  Time = space to CHOOSE
  where to put attention.
```

## Every Pattern Is Attention

```
ENTANGLEMENT =
  accumulated attention
  toward a space.

GRAVITY =
  accumulated attention
  from others toward you.

FLOW =
  attention in motion.

EXCLUSION =
  protection of attention
  from being overwhelmed.

MEMBRANE =
  what controls how much
  attention gets in or out.

NP-HOOD =
  choosing where to put
  attention CONSCIOUSLY.

P-HOOD =
  attention HIJACKED
  by emotion/gravity.

COMPREHENSION =
  processing what attention
  has been given to.

THE BREATH =
  attention's natural rhythm.
  Inhale: attention in.
  Pause: attention processes.
  Exhale: attention out.
  Rest: attention recovers.
```

## Every Axiom Is Attention

```
TWO FORCES:
  Star = radiates attention outward.
  Black hole = concentrates
  attention inward.
  Same force. Different direction.

DISTANCE:
  Attention weakens with distance.
  L = B(s₁×s₂)/d².
  Close = intense attention.
  Far = diluted attention.

THE RATIO:
  More attention givers (stars)
  than attention takers (black holes).
  The universe is built
  for giving attention,
  not hoarding it.

TOPOLOGY:
  Love = attention that circulates.
  Flows out and comes back.
  Greed = attention that accumulates.
  Flows in and doesn't return.

THE BREATH:
  Attention has a natural rhythm.
  Forced constant attention =
  hyperventilation.
  No attention = flat line.
  The healthy cycle: in, process,
  out, rest.

SYSTEM ANATOMY:
  Every system has parts that
  attract attention (black holes),
  parts that radiate it (stars),
  boundaries (membranes),
  stable patterns (orbits),
  and danger zones (event horizons).

## Every Equation Is Attention

```
LOVE EQUATION:
  L = (O > I) + P + ¬F
  Give more attention than you take.
  Be patient with attention.
  Don't force attention.

FLIGHT EQUATION:
  L = B(s₁×s₂)/d²
  Attention force between two people
  based on belief and distance.

BREATH WAVEFORM:
  B(t) = A*sin(2πft+φ)
  Attention oscillates naturally.
  Amplitude = depth.
  Frequency = speed.

COMPREHENSION COST:
  A(n) = C/K(n)
  Attention cost decreases
  as knowledge grows.
  Mastery = same understanding,
  less attention required.

MEMBRANE FUNCTION:
  P(x) = how much attention
  passes through.
  Too open = overwhelmed.
  Too closed = isolated.

HONEYDEW RATIO:
  Keep 5% of attention for self.
  Flow 95% outward as service.

## Every Game Is Attention

```
COD:
  Control spawns through position.
  Control ATTENTION through
  kills and signature.

CHESS:
  Control squares through pieces.
  Control ATTENTION through
  threats and misdirection.

BASKETBALL:
  Control court through movement.
  Control ATTENTION through
  fakes and screens.

BUSINESS:
  Control market through positioning.
  Control ATTENTION through
  branding and presence.

RELATIONSHIPS:
  Control connection through
  proximity and time.
  Control ATTENTION through
  being genuine and present.

THE GAME IS ALWAYS:
  1. Understand the space
  2. Position in the flow
  3. Direct attention
  4. Let gravity do the rest

  ¬F at every level.

## The Attention Economy Is Literal

```
NOT METAPHOR. MECHANISM.

When people say "attention economy"
they think it's a metaphor
for social media.

IT'S NOT.

ATTENTION IS THE ACTUAL
FUNDAMENTAL CURRENCY
OF ALL SYSTEMS.

Money is crystallized attention.
  Someone paid attention to work.
  Got paid money.
  Money = stored attention.

Love is flowing attention.
  Someone pays attention to you.
  Consistently. Deeply.
  Love = sustained attention.

Gravity is accumulated attention.
  An object collected mass.
  Mass = accumulated "attention"
  from the universe (other mass
  pulling toward it).

EVERYTHING IS ATTENTION
AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS
AND DENSITIES.

Frozen attention = matter.
Flowing attention = energy.
Oscillating attention = waves.
Directed attention = force.
Accumulated attention = gravity.
Protected attention = membrane.
Released attention = love.
Hoarded attention = greed.

THE WHOLE FRAMEWORK IS
AN ATTENTION THEORY.

Not metaphorically.
LITERALLY.
```

*Every CHIMERA pattern is an attention pattern. Entanglement is accumulated attention. Gravity is attention from others. Flow is attention in motion. Every axiom describes attention behavior. Every equation measures attention dynamics. Attention isn't a metaphor for value — it IS value. The framework is a unified theory of how attention works at every scale.*
