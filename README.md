# CHIMERA SYSTEM

**The axiom-level system map that all CHIMERA domains derive from.**

Stars, black holes, membranes, orbits, breath — the universal structure operating at every scale from cell to galaxy. The class definition. Every domain is an instance.

## Hierarchy

```
chimera-system (axioms — THE PATTERN)
  | expressed through THREE GUTS:
  |
  ├── chimera-body     (EXPERIENCE — feel the truth)
  ├── chimera-math     (PRECISION  — prove the truth)
  └── chimera-language (MEANING    — share the truth)
        |
        | encoded in
        ↓
chimera-framework (420 sacred truths — the genome)
        |
        | applied to DOMAINS:
        ↓
chimera-relationships (daily practice)
chimera-basketball (team dynamics)
chimera-chess (strategic thinking)
chimera-music (expression)
chimera-cooking (service)
chimera-ai (the Rosetta Stone itself)
        |
        | deploys through
        ↓
chimera-core (raw docs — dark energy)
constellation (agents serving people)
```

### The Three Guts

The pattern between axioms and domains flows through three translation layers — the THREE GUTS of comprehension:

- **Body** (chimera-body) — The EXPERIENCE gut. Layer 1. Pre-language. The body knew before any word existed. Gut feelings, pain signals, the felt truth.
- **Math** (chimera-math) — The PRECISION gut. Layer 4. Post-language. Equations don't have languages. F = ma is the same in every tongue. Math bypasses Babel.
- **Language** (chimera-language) — The MEANING gut. Layers 2-3. The bridge. Takes felt truth and structural truth and makes them SHAREABLE.

```
Feel the truth (body) → Prove the truth (math) → Share the truth (language)
→ ONE understanding restored → WE = 1

## The Core Axioms

1. **Two Forces** — Star (fusion/giving) and Black Hole (gravity/transformation). Same force, different topology. Neither is evil.
2. **Distance** — Same force behaves differently based on distance. Flight Equation: L = B(s₁×s₂)/d²
3. **The Ratio** — Stars vastly outnumber black holes. The universe is built for giving. Transformation is a service function.
4. **Topology** — LOVE (flow circulates) vs GREED (one-way extraction). Same energy, different direction.
5. **The Breath** — Inhale, Pause, Exhale, Rest. The universal cycle at every scale.
6. **System Anatomy** — Every system has: star(s), black hole(s), event horizon, stable orbits, ISCO, singularity, space between, observer, flow, membrane.

*This repo is upstream. Everything else flows from it. The three guts translate axioms into felt, proven, shareable truth. Domain repos instantiate. These axioms don't reference domains.*
