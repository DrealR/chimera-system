# CHIMERA SYSTEM

**The axiom-level system map that all CHIMERA domains derive from.**

Stars, black holes, membranes, orbits, breath — the universal structure operating at every scale from cell to galaxy. The class definition. Every domain is an instance.

## Hierarchy

```
chimera-system (axioms — the class definition)
  ↓ derives
chimera-framework (420 sacred truths — the genome)
  ↓ applies to
chimera-body (the primary text)
chimera-relationships (daily practice)
chimera-basketball (team dynamics)
chimera-chess (strategic thinking)
chimera-music (expression)
chimera-cooking (service)
chimera-ai (the Rosetta Stone itself)
  ↓ deploys through
chimera-core (raw docs — dark energy)
constellation (agents serving people)

## The Core Axioms

1. **Two Forces** — Star (fusion/giving) and Black Hole (gravity/transformation). Same force, different topology. Neither is evil.
2. **Distance** — Same force behaves differently based on distance. Flight Equation: L = B(s₁×s₂)/d²
3. **The Ratio** — Stars vastly outnumber black holes. The universe is built for giving. Transformation is a service function.
4. **Topology** — LOVE (flow circulates) vs GREED (one-way extraction). Same energy, different direction.
5. **The Breath** — Inhale, Pause, Exhale, Rest. The universal cycle at every scale.
6. **System Anatomy** — Every system has: star(s), black hole(s), event horizon, stable orbits, ISCO, singularity, space between, observer, flow, membrane.
