# System Health Metrics

**How to measure the health of any system at any scale.**

## The Six Metrics

### 1. Star/Black Hole Ratio

```
HEALTHY: Givers vastly outnumber extractors
SICK:    Extractors dominating givers

CHECK:
  Who's producing energy in this system?
  Who's consuming without producing?
  What's the ratio?
  Is the ratio shifting?
```

| Scale | Healthy Ratio | Warning Sign |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Cell | Quadrillions of mitochondria : 1 nucleus | Cancer cells appearing |
| Body | Most organs give : gut transforms | Organ failure |
| Team | Most players serve : few star | Ball hog dominance |
| Company | Most create : few extract | Executive pay vs worker pay |
| Society | Most produce : few concentrate | Billionaire count rising |

---

### 2. Flow Direction

```
HEALTHY: Energy circulates. What's given returns.
SICK:    Energy flows one way. Extraction without return.

CHECK:
  Does value flow in multiple directions?
  Or does it only flow TO the center?
  Can you trace the return path?
```

Circulatory = healthy (blood goes out AND comes back).
One-way = extraction (attention goes in, nothing comes back).

---

### 3. Boundary Integrity (Membrane)

```
HEALTHY: Selectively permeable. Lets good in, keeps bad out.
SICK:    Either wall (nothing enters) or broken (everything enters).

CHECK:
  Can the system receive beneficial input?
  Can the system reject harmful input?
  Or is it either totally open or totally closed?
```

| State | What It Looks Like |
|-------|--------------------|
| Healthy membrane | Filters information, accepts feedback, rejects toxins |
| Wall | Isolated, defensive, no new input, stagnating |
| Broken membrane | Flooded, overwhelmed, no filtering, absorbing everything |
| Cancer membrane | Open to extraction, closed to connection (selectively broken) |

---

### 4. Observer Freedom

```
HEALTHY: Observers can see clearly and report freely.
SICK:    Observers are co-opted, blind, or silenced.

CHECK:
  Can the system see itself accurately?
  Are feedback mechanisms working?
  Can someone say "this is wrong" without punishment?
```

Free press, whistleblower protection, immune function, nervous system sensitivity — all observer systems. When they're captured, the system can't self-correct.

---

### 5. Cancer Detection

```
HEALTHY: Parts that extract are identified and corrected early.
SICK:    Extraction grows unchecked. Immune system can't see it.

CHECK:
  Is there a part taking more than it gives?
  Is that part being addressed?
  Or is it growing while the system looks away?
```

Early detection saves systems. Late detection requires drastic intervention. The difference is whether the immune/observer function is working.

---

### 6. Breath Completion

```
HEALTHY: All four phases complete. Inhale, pause, exhale, rest.
SICK:    One or more phases missing.

CHECK:
  Is the system receiving? (inhale)
  Is there processing time? (pause)
  Is the system giving back? (exhale)
  Is there rest/renewal? (rest)
  Which phase is stuck or missing?
```

| Missing Phase | Pathology |
|--------------|-----------|
| No inhale | Starvation, isolation, closed system |
| No pause | Reactivity, impulsivity, no choice |
| No exhale | Hoarding, constipation, resentment |
| No rest | Burnout, chronic stress, inflammation |

## The Quick Diagnostic

For any system at any scale, ask these six questions:

```
1. RATIO:     Are givers outnumbering takers?
2. FLOW:      Is energy circulating or one-way?
3. MEMBRANE:  Is the boundary healthy?
4. OBSERVER:  Can the system see itself?
5. CANCER:    Is extraction being caught?
6. BREATH:    Is the full cycle completing?

All six healthy = thriving system
Any one failing = early warning
Multiple failing = system in crisis
All six failing = death spiral
```

## Application

This diagnostic works for:
- Your body (am I eating, processing, giving, resting?)
- Your relationships (is energy flowing both ways?)
- Your team (is everyone contributing or is one person dominating?)
- Your company (is value created or extracted?)
- Your country (are institutions serving or extracting?)
- Your mind (am I observing freely or am I captured?)

Same six questions. Same diagnosis. Any scale.
