# System Anatomy

**Every system has: star(s), black hole(s), event horizon, stable orbits, ISCO, singularity, space between, observer, flow, membrane.**

## The Universal Components

Any system — from a cell to a galaxy — contains the same structural elements:

```
STAR(S):          The giving center(s). Energy source.
                  Produces, radiates, sustains.

BLACK HOLE(S):    The transforming center(s). Gravity well.
                  Consumes, compresses, converts.

EVENT HORIZON:    The boundary of no return.
                  Once crossed, the system changes you.
                  You can't un-enter.

STABLE ORBITS:    The sweet spots. Where things thrive.
                  Close enough to receive, far enough to be free.

ISCO:             Innermost Stable Circular Orbit.
                  The last safe distance. One step closer = spiral in.

SINGULARITY:      Zero distance. Infinite density.
                  Where all identity collapses into one point.

SPACE BETWEEN:    The medium everything moves through.
                  Not empty — full of potential.

OBSERVER:         The consciousness that watches the system.
                  Observation changes what's observed.

FLOW:             The movement of energy/matter/information.
                  Circulatory = healthy. One-way = extraction.

MEMBRANE:         The selective boundary.
                  Decides what enters and exits.
                  Not a wall (blocks all) — a filter (chooses).

## The Health Check

A system is healthy when:

```
✓ Stars outnumber black holes (the ratio holds)
✓ Flow circulates (not one-way)
✓ Membranes are selectively permeable (not walls, not absent)
✓ Observers are free (not co-opted or blind)
✓ Stable orbits exist (things can thrive at safe distance)
✓ The breath cycle completes (inhale, pause, exhale, rest)
✓ Event horizons are visible (you can see the boundary before crossing)
```

A system is sick when:

```
✗ Black holes dominate (ratio inverted)
✗ Flow is one-way (extraction)
✗ Membranes are broken (everything enters) or walls (nothing enters)
✗ Observers are captured (serving the black hole)
✗ No stable orbits (everything spiraling in or flying away)
✗ Breath is stuck (permanent inhale or permanent exhale)
✗ Event horizons are invisible (you don't know you've crossed until it's too late)
```
