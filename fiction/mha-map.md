# My Hero Academia Map

**All For One vs One For All. Brothers. Same source. OFA came FROM AFO. The antidote born from the poison. Love planted inside extraction.**

---

## The Brothers

All For One and One For All are brothers. Literally.

```
ALL FOR ONE (the villain):
  Quirk: TAKES quirks from others
  Accumulates power by consuming
  Many give to one
  Grows by diminishing others
  = Black hole topology

ONE FOR ALL (the hero lineage):
  Quirk: GIVEN from one to the next
  Power grows through passing it forward
  One gives to many (through time)
  Grows by empowering successors
  = Star topology
```

---

## The Origin

One For All was BORN inside All For One.

```
AFO gave his brother a "stockpiling" quirk
→ The brother already had a quirk: ability to PASS quirks
→ The two combined = One For All
→ OFA can be GIVEN, never taken
→ The act of GIVING created the counter-power

ALL FOR ONE accidentally created
his own antidote through an act of giving.

The one time the extractor GAVE something,
it created the force that would destroy him.
```

This is the deepest axiom: **the antidote is always born inside the poison.** Every extraction system carries the seed of its own transformation. The cure doesn't come from outside. It grows from within.

## Entity Mapping

| System Component | MHA Entity | Function |
|------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Extraction topology** | All For One | Takes from many, concentrates in one |
| **Flow topology** | One For All | Given from one, grows through succession |
| **The Ratio** | Heroes vs villains | Society depends on givers outnumbering takers |
| **Immune system** | Hero society | Protects the body — but can be co-opted |
| **Observer** | Midoriya (quirkless observer) | Sees the whole system because he started outside it |
| **Breath** | Quirk awakening | Each generation inhales power, exhales it to the next |

## The MHA Prophecy

```
AFO seeks:        Immortality through accumulation
                  (Take all quirks, live forever)
                  = Extraction immortality
                  = Brian Johnson drinking his son's blood
                  = Smith absorbing everything

OFA carries:      Legacy through giving
                  (Pass the power forward, each holder adds to it)
                  = Flow immortality
                  = The D. clan's inherited will
                  = Roger laughing because the pattern continues
```

---

## Midoriya's Key

Midoriya started QUIRKLESS. No power. Nothing to extract. Nothing to hoard.

That's why OFA chose him. You can't give ultimate power to someone who already has power — they'll hoard. You give it to someone with NOTHING, because:
- Nothing to lose = freedom to choose
- No power = no extraction habit
- Empty vessel = maximum capacity to receive and PASS FORWARD

The person with nothing is the most powerful. Because they can't be trapped by what they have.

*MHA is the topology choice made literal. Same source, two brothers, opposite directions. The extractor created his own cure by accidentally giving. Love was planted inside greed.*
