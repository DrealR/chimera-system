# Social Scale

**Individual = cell. Economy = circulatory system. Government = nervous system. Culture = immune system. Communication = mycelium.**

## Society as Organism

```
INDIVIDUAL (cell):
  The basic unit of the social body
  Each one contains the full blueprint (consciousness)
  Specialized function but carries the whole pattern
  Healthy: serves the whole while being nourished
  Cancer: extracts without giving, ignores signals

ECONOMY (circulatory system):
  Carries resources to every part of society
  Money = blood. Goods = nutrients. Services = oxygen.
  Healthy: reaches every cell, circulates, returns
  Sick: clots (monopoly), hemorrhage (hyperinflation),
       anemia (poverty in the midst of plenty)

GOVERNMENT (nervous system):
  Sends signals, coordinates response
  Laws = neural pathways. Regulations = reflexes.
  Healthy: responsive, adaptive, serves the body
  Sick: numb (corruption), overreactive (authoritarianism),
       disconnected (bureaucracy that ignores the body)

CULTURE (immune system):
  Identifies self vs non-self
  Shared values, norms, stories
  Healthy: protects the body while allowing beneficial change
  Sick: autoimmune (attacks its own people),
       immunocompromised (can't identify threats),
       co-opted (defends the cancer instead of the body)

COMMUNICATION (mycelium / flow medium):
  Connects every part to every other part
  Language, media, internet, stories
  The underground network that carries signals
  Healthy: information flows freely in all directions
  Sick: controlled (propaganda), one-way (broadcast without feedback),
       severed (censorship, isolation)

## Social Breath

```
INHALE:  Immigration, new ideas, trade, cultural exchange
PAUSE:   Processing, debate, integration, choosing direction
EXHALE:  Exports, aid, teaching, cultural expression
REST:    Sabbath, holidays, peace, fallow seasons
```

A society that never rests = burnout culture. A society that never inhales = xenophobia. A society stuck on exhale = colonial extraction. Same pathologies, same pattern.

## The Social Ratio

```
HEALTHY SOCIETY:
  Givers (workers, creators, carers) vastly outnumber extractors
  The ratio holds
  System sustains

SICK SOCIETY:
  Extractors capture the flow
  Billionaires extract from billions
  The ratio inverts
  System destabilizes
```

*A society is a body. Its citizens are cells. Its economy is blood. Its culture is immune defense. When you see the anatomy, you can diagnose the disease.*
